Orders-TS is a typescript based server to perform automated trading. It is based on my previous Python based project, and was made due to the deployment package in my previous project growing too large for AWS Lambda's 50mb deployment package limit.

This project utilises the following dependencies:

- TradingView Webhooks
- Next.js
- Alpaca API JS SDK
- Sentry
- PostgreSQL database
- Upstash
