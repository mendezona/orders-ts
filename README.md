Orders-TS is a typescript based server to perform automated trading. It is based on my previous Python based project, and was made due to the deployment package in my previous project being too large for AWS Lambda functions.

This project utilises the following dependencies:

- TradingView Webhooks
- Next.js
- Alpaca API
- Sentry
- PostgreSQL database
